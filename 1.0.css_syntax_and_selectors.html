	<h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
	<p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and declaration block:</p>
	<img src="/home/lethal/Desktop/Screenshot from 2017-04-06 17-29-05.png" alt="CSS Syntax">

<p id="p1">The selectors points to the HTML element you want to style.<br>
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.<br>
A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<br>
</p>

<h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
<p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute and more.</p>

<h2>The element Selector</h2>
<p>The element selector selects elements based on the element name.<br>
You can select all &gt;p&lt; elements on a page like this.</p>

<h2>The id Selector</h2>
<p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to selelct a specific element.<br>
The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!<br>
To slelect an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.<br>
</p>

<h2>The class Selector</h2>
<p>The class Selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.</p>
<p>To select elements with a specific class, write a period(.) character, followed by the name of the class.</p>
<p>In the example below al HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:</p>
<h3 class="center">Red and center-aligned heading</h3>
<p class="center">Red an center-aligned paragraph.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>A class name cannot start with a number.</p>
<p>HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.<br>
In the example below, the < p > element will be styled according to class</p>
<h3 class="center">This headin will not be affected</h3>
<p class="center">This paragraph will be red and center-aligned.</p>
<p class="center large">This pararaph will be red, center-aligned and in a large font-size.</p>

<h2>CSS Comments</h2>
<p>Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.<br>
Comments are ignored by browsers.<br>
A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */. Comments can also span multiple lines.</p>
